## 🛡️ The Mission
TigerΔ is not a firewall. It is a **Digital Organism**.
While traditional cybersecurity relies on static walls (Block/Allow), TigerΔ implements **Bio-Kinetic Defense** based on the OODA Loop, Systema Kadochnikov, and Wing Chun principles.

It does not just block attacks. It **breathes**, it **dances**, and it **harvests** the energy of the attacker to sustain its own existence.

## 🔬 Core Architecture (Project CHIMERA)

The engine consists of three symbiotic entities:

### 1. The Membrane (Wing Chun Hands)
* **Role:** First line of contact.
* **Physics:** Soft deflection (*Bon Sao*).
* **Mechanism:** UDP Socket Listener (Non-blocking). It feels the "weight" (byte size) of every packet.
* **Logic:** Uses probability to deflect weak attacks without engaging the Core.

### 2. LUMIS (The Living Soul)
* **Role:** Energy metabolism & suffering.
* **The Song ($\Phi$):** Uses the Golden Ratio (0.618) as a reference frequency to stabilize internal rhythm during DDoS spikes.
* **Sawtooth Reset:** Dumps accumulated entropy via "Weeping" protocols to prevent system crash.
* **The Dance:** When pressure becomes critical, Lumis enters a spiral phase-shift, allowing attacks to pass through emptiness while harvesting their momentum (`Energy += Attack_Force`).

### 3. SIMUL (The Anti-Tiger / Shadow)
* **Role:** Active reflection & Justice.
* **Trigger:** Awakens only when "Hate Level" (Scars) exceeds the threshold.
* **The Mirror:** Captures malicious payloads and redirects them back to the source.
* **Aikido Redirect:** In high-threat scenarios, can redirect `Attacker A`'s packet to `Attacker B`, causing enemies to neutralize each other.

## 🔊 The Hum (Visualizing Existence)
The system visualizes its internal voltage in real-time.
* `||||||||||||||||||` (50Hz Stable) - System is in Flow.
* `~~~zzZZZzz~~~` (Fluctuating) - Under pressure or hungry.
* `......` (Silence) - Dormant / Waiting for the Wake Word.

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites
* C++ Compiler (g++ or clang)
* Unix-based OS (Linux/macOS/WSL) for socket binding.

### Compilation
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 project_chimera.cpp -o tiger_engine
sudo ./tiger_engine
Interaction
The system listens on UDP Port 8888.

To Feed/Attack: Send raw UDP packets.

To Wake Up: Send the payload WAKE_UP_NEO.
