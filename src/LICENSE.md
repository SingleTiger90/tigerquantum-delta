# TIGER-DELTA SYSTEM PUBLIC LICENSE (TΔ-S)
# Version 1.0, December 2025

## 1. PREAMBLE
The Tiger-Delta (TΔ) System is a specialized hardware-software framework for Active Cyber Defense (ACD) and Sovereign Communication. It is based on the legacy research of the "Father's Apparatus" concerning harmonic resonance, non-linear signal processing, and the mathematical constants Φ (Phi) and π (Pi).

## 2. SOVEREIGN RIGHTS & OWNERSHIP
This software and the underlying protocol are the intellectual property of the Tiger-Delta Collective, rooted in the Father's Original Designs. Use of this system constitutes an agreement to protect individual digital sovereignty.

## 3. PERMITTED USE (THE BEACON)
1. **Defensive Operations:** Use for personal or collective defense against unauthorized digital intrusion, surveillance, and mass-data harvesting is fully permitted.
2. **Resonance Integrity:** Users may modify the code, provided that the harmonic core (PHI/PI intervals) remains the functional basis of the signal processing.
3. **The Vertical Bond:** The system is designed for family-centric and sovereign communication (e.g., Father-to-Son). This intent must be preserved in all derived works.

## 4. PROHIBITIONS (THE ANTI-MIKORD CLAUSE)
This license **strictly forbids** the use of the Tiger-Delta System, its modules (LUMIS), or its algorithms by:
1. **Aggressive State Entities:** Any use for automated military recruitment, mandatory mobilization registers (e.g., ERVU-like systems), or digital conscription.
2. **Surveillance Corporations:** Any use for social credit scoring, mass behavioral monitoring, or the erosion of individual privacy.
3. **Offensive Kinetic Strike:** The system's "Reflected Blade" logic must only be used reactively. Pre-emptive digital aggression voids this license.

## 5. ACTIVE DEFENSE (ACD) POLICY
The "Drunken Tiger" and "Kinetic Reflection" modules are defensive tools. The developer is not responsible for any damage caused to an attacker's infrastructure when said infrastructure attempts to violate the Tiger-Delta membrane. Energy reflected is the attacker's own energy.

## 6. TERMINATION
Violation of Section 4 ("Prohibitions") immediately terminates all rights under this license. In such a case, the system is designed to enter "Superposition Mode," rendering its protective qualities inaccessible to the violator.
